    description = Medium sized container for metastable metallic hydrogen. When a method of creating and storing this highly energetic substance was unveiled at a Violet Technologies presentation some boring theoretical physisists started objecting and saying something about quantum tunneling. They were promptly booed out of the room by a rowdy crowd of engineers.
